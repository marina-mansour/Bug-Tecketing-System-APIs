# 🐞 Bug Ticketing System

## Overview

The **Bug Ticketing System** is a .NET Web API application designed to help software teams efficiently manage bugs and issues in projects. With this system, Managers, Developers, and Testers can report, track, assign, and resolve bugs. The application supports authentication and autherization, user management, file attachments and password hashing for better security.

## 🧩 Key Concepts

### Users

- Three roles: **Manager**, **Developer**, **Tester**
- A user can have multiple roles and can be assigned to different bugs

### Projects

- Each project contains multiple bugs
- Each bug belongs to a single project

### Bugs

- Bugs can be assigned to multiple users
- Bugs can have multiple attachments (e.g., images, logs)

### Attachments

- Linked to specific bugs for more context or evidence

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** ASP.NET Core Web API Using NTier Architecture
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Token)
- **Password Hashing:** BCrypt
- **Database:** Entity Framework Core (SQL Server)

## 🛠️ Future Plan

Modify it to work as a Full-Stack System with a website interface to help users to collaborate together through assigning bugs to projects and so on using MVC
